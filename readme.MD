# Chrome Extension

- This is my first chrome extension which I found useful
  - It saves all your open tabs into a session
    - Sessions can be opened again with a click -> they open in a new Window
    - No need to have 100 tabs open when researching. Just save it and open it later if you want.
    - You can also delete

## Instalation

- Currently not in the dev store... you have to pay 5â‚¬ and i can't buy bread atm.
