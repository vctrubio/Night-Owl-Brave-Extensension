# Chrome Extension

- This is my first chrome extension which I found useful
  - It saves all your open tabs into a session
    - Sessions can be opened again with a click -> they open in a new Window
    - No need to have 100 tabs open when researching. Just save it and open it later if you want.
    - You can also delete

## Instalation

- Currently earnign 5€ to put it up on the dev store.

## Testing runthrough

Open Chrome → Extensions → Enable "Developer mode" → "Load unpacked" → Select your folder.

## Version 1.1

My goal are simple

- update the ui, top give it more of a developer feel, like me
- create an key listener, to expand into quick navigtion
